          As a <em>developer</em>, I love writing code that makes peopleâ€™s lives easier. Iâ€™m excited
          about pushing the web forward, and the possibilities offered by the latest tools and
          technology. As a <em>designer</em>, my focus is on producing simple, intuitive products
          that allow people to get work done. I love building pragmatic, accessible interfaces that
          are attractive and easy to use.

          I want the web to work. Iâ€™m a strong proponent of a{' '}
          <a href="http://futurefriendlyweb.com/">future friendly</a>,{' '}
          <a href="https://www.webstandards.org/">standards compliant</a> web, and believe in a
          responsibly delivered, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">accessible</a> experience for
          everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also like <em>fun</em> things, such as riding my bike, and brewing my own beer. I spend
          my days building tools that help make the web faster, and <em>I love it</em>.
