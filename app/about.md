G'day, my name is <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/" class="fn p-name url u-url">{{site.author.name}}</a>.

Iâ€™m a <span class="title p-title">{{site.author.role}}</span> based in <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Melbourne+VIC"><span class="locality p-locality">{{site.author.location.city}}</span>, <span class="country-name p-country-name">{{site.author.location.country}}</span></a>. I'm a fan of the Open Web, and love using technology to help solve problems.

As a *developer*, I love writing code that makes peoples lives easier. I'm excited about pushing the web forward, and the possibilities offered by the latest tools and technology. As a *designer*, my focus is on producing simple, intuitive products that allow people to get work done. I love building pragmatic, accessible interfaces that are attractive and easy to use.

I want the web to work. I'm a strong proponent of a [future friendly](http://futurefriend.ly), [standards compliant](http://webstandards.org "The Web Standards Project") web, and believe in an [accessible](http://www.w3.org/WAI "Web Accessibility Initiative") experience for everyone.

I also like _fun_ things, such as riding my bike and brewing my own beer. I spend my days building tools that help people learn, and *I love it*.
