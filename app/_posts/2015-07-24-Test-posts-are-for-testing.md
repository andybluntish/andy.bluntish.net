Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! Dad didn't leave… When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face!

## Last Exit to Springfield

I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer? Save me, Jeebus.

*   I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die.
*   Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.
*   Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot.
*   I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.

### Marge vs. Monorail

Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Thank you, steal again.

#### Hurricane Neddy

How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer? Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*

1.  Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition.
2.  I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die.
3.  Please do not offer my god a peanut.

##### A Streetcar Named Marge

What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. Inflammable means flammable? What a country.

###### Natural Born Kissers

Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot. Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Me fail English? That's unpossible. I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.

```js
const _ = {};
_.uniq = function(array, isSorted, iteratee, thisArg) {
  const length = array ? array.length : 0;
  if (!length) {
    return [];
  }
  if (isSorted != null && typeof isSorted != 'boolean') {
    thisArg = iteratee;
    iteratee = isIterateeCall(array, isSorted, thisArg) ? undefined : isSorted;
    isSorted = false;
  }
  const callback = getCallback();
  if (!(iteratee == null && callback === baseCallback)) {
    iteratee = callback(iteratee, thisArg, 3);
  }
  return (isSorted && getIndexOf() == baseIndexOf)
    ? sortedUniq(array, iteratee)
    : baseUniq(array, iteratee);
};
```

```js
_.uniq([2, 1, 2]);
// → [2, 1]

// using `isSorted`
_.uniq([1, 1, 2], true);
// → [1, 2]

// using an iteratee function
_.uniq([1, 2.5, 1.5, 2], (n) => {
  return Math.floor(n);
});
// → [1, 2.5]

// using the `_.property` callback shorthand
_.uniq([{ 'x': 1 }, { 'x': 2 }, { 'x': 1 }], 'x');
// → [{ 'x': 1 }, { 'x': 2 }]
```

But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold. Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. Please do not offer my god a peanut. I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!

Some inline `Ruby` code: `lambda { |x, y| return x + y }`.

Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. I was saying "Boo-urns." That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them.

Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about! How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot. Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me?

Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies. Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot. I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows. Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. You don't win friends with salad. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel.

Homer no function beer well without. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.

Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people. I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies. This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story." Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. Thank you, steal again.

It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel. I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.

A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box… I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children.

Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!" Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.

I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Ahoy hoy? Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. Homer no function beer well without.

Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city! Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*

Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot. How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive? I hope I didn't brain my damage. He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency.

Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. Me fail English? That's unpossible.
