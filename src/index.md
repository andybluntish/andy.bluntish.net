G'day, my name is <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/" class="fn p-name url u-url">{{ site.data.author.name | split: ' ' | first }}</a>. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a <span class="title p-title">{{ site.data.author.role }}</span> based in <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/{{ site.data.author.location.city }}+{{ site.data.author.location.region.abbr }}+{{ site.data.author.location.country }}"><span class="locality p-locality">{{ site.data.author.location.city }}</span>, <span class="country-name p-country-name">{{ site.data.author.location.country }}</span></a>. I'm a huge fan of the web, and love using technology to help solve problems.

As a *developer*, I love writing code that makes peoples lives easier. I'm excited about pushing the web forward, and the possibilities offered by the latest tools and technology. As a *designer*, my focus is on producing simple, intuitive products that allow people to get work done. I love building pragmatic, accessible interfaces that are attractive and easy to use.

I want the web to work. I'm a strong proponent of a [future friendly](http://futurefriendlyweb.com/), [standards compliant](http://www.webstandards.org/ "The Web Standards Project") web, and believe in a responsibly delivered, [accessible](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ "Web Accessibility Initiative") experience for everyone.

I also like _fun_ things, such as riding my bike and brewing my own beer. I spend my days building tools that help people learn, and *I love it*.
